      <p>
        I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hit me with a cricket bat. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You've swallowed a planet! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
