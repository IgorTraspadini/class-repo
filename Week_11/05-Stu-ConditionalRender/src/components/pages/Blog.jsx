        All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You've swallowed a planet! You've swallowed a planet! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
